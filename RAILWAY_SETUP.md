# Railway Monorepo Configuration
# This file is not needed - deploy each service separately!

# Instead of trying to deploy from root, you need to:
# 1. Create TWO separate services in Railway
# 2. For each service, set the Root Directory

# Service 1: Frontend
# Root Directory: frontend
# Uses: frontend/Dockerfile

# Service 2: Backend  
# Root Directory: backend
# Uses: backend/Dockerfile
